The code is to calculate the intrinsic neural timescale (INT) in R. To run the code, we provide the following instructions.

1. System requirements:

Hardware Requirements:

To implement the source code, it requires only a standard computer with enough RAM to support the operations defined by a user. For minimal performance, this will be a computer with about 2 GB of RAM. For optimal performance, we recommend a computer with the following specs:

CPU 4+ cores, 4.00+ GHz/core
RAM 32.0+ GB

The runtimes below are generated using a computer with the recommended specs (32 GB RAM, 4 cores@4.0 GHz) and internet of speed 200 Mbps.

Software Requirements:

The source code is written in R, which is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics. It is suggested to use RStudio to run the source code, which has a better GUI environment. Users should have R version 4.0.4 or higher, RStudio version 2022.02.3+492 or higher.

2. Installation Guide

R can be freely downloaded at https://www.r-project.org/

RStudio can be downloaded with the choice of free version at https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/

The download time should be within a minute.
